<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is Machine Learning?

[![Linear Regression Example][product-screenshot]]


Welcome to the Machine Learning for Beginners repository! This repository is designed to provide a starting point for individuals who are new to machine learning and want to develop their skills and knowledge.

Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms analyze data, learn from that data, and make a prediction about something in the world. It is being used to solve real-world problems across various industries such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.
